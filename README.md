![List of content](/_media/m3w3/content-list.png)
![Content Detail](/_media/m3w3/content-detail.jpg)

- It's not required to be pixel perfect.
- Animations which could not be replicated with only CSS are not required or should be implemented partially.

Clone this repository and work in a single branch with your team, the branch should be named to identify your team members -eg. you could use your initials to name it- and the extended project week (_w1_ in this case).
